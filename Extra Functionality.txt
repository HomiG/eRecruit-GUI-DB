


The GUI project has been implemented in JavaFX. 

I have imported the library "com.jfoenix:jfoenix:9.0.9" from which I am  using buttons, text fields, date pickers.
Views from this library work excactly the same way, they jsut look better.


RECRUITER:

->My jobs.

Closed jobs check box STATE_CHECKED prints the jobs that their submision date has passed (current day).
Closed jobs check box STATE_UNCHECKED prints all the jobs.

-> Insert Job.

When a recruiter inserts a new job, they can decide if he wants to add an Antikeimeno to this job.
	If this antikeim already exists then just type the name of Antikeim into Antikeimeno field.
	If they want to insert a new antikeim they  just type the into Antikeimeno, Antikeim Description,
	belongs_to field and click add Antikeimeno, the new Antikeim will be Created And also added to this job.
	
-> Evaluate Interviews.

When a recruiter see the list of interviews, they can edit the completed ones just by clicking into the 
personality/education/experience columns and then pressing ENTER to  save the changes and update the database.
If the interview has -1 into these columns it means that the job application has not been evaluated yet.
To Evaluate: just click the desired columns to change the values and press ENTER to save the chagnes.
Also complete the duaration  and comments field and CLICK ADD NEW INTERVIEW.

WHEN ADDING A NEW INTERVIEW if the 0<personality/education/experiece<5 the value will change to the closer limit.


ADMIN:

-> Action History.

When they want to filter the table of action history they can choose either user or table or Both
but they need to specify the date limits.




FILES PATH: db_proj_1054429_1054406/B MEROS/Project/src/JavaFX


ALL TRIGERS AND THE STORED PORCEDURE MUST BE INSERTED INTO DATABASE!! OTHERWISE SOME FUNCTIONALITIES WILL NOT WORK.
